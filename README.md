# Color-Compression-Using-Unsupervised-ML

Many display devices allow only a limited number of colors to be simultaneously displayed. Therefore, true color images may need to be converted to indexed color images for the purpose of saving storage space or display in restricted display devices  In this project, functions are defined to compress the images using some unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms such as k-means, winner takes all and Kohonen maps.
